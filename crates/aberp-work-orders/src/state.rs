//! Work-order state machine per ADR-0062 §2.
//!
//! The transition table is the application-layer invariant — no DB
//! CHECK enforces it per [[no-sql-specific]] + ADR-0062 §"Cross-cutting
//! decisions" #2. [`next_state`] is a pure function: given the current
//! state and an operator/adapter action, returns the next state or a
//! typed error naming the refused edge.
//!
//! `transition_wo` (the repository-level write path in
//! `handlers.rs`) consults `next_state` as its first gate; illegal
//! transitions are refused with [`WoStateError::IllegalTransition`]
//! BEFORE any DB write per the [[trust-code-not-operator]] +
//! `loud-fail` posture.
